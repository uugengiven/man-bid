### Linux (2 Weeks):

This project is to create an OpenStack environment using one of the Hypervisors listed: VMWare, HyperV, KVM

This project should follow the basic OpenStack setup as seen here: http://docs.openstack.org/newton/install-guide-ubuntu/

After creating a fully functioning OpenStack environment that allows for multi-tenant hosting, the next steps are to create three hosted projects:

 * Webcache via nginx
 * Wordpress site with a "hell world" type page
 * Gitlab installation that allows users to log in and store code


 ### Tests for Completion

 * OpenStack administration site loads and two separate users exist with separate machines/domains/spaces

 * Gitlab site loads and allows user to log in

 * Wordpress site loads

 * Downloads that go through the webcache are faster, logs show downloads happening via webcache
